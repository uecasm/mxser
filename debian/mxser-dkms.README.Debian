mxser/mxupcie for Debian

The kernel modules for the MOXA Smartio/Industio family of serial adapters
are provided as a dkms source package.  Installing it should automatically
build and install the drivers into your current kernel, and optionally all
others installed on your system.  (See the DKMS manpages for more info.)

The README.TXT.gz and VERSION.TXT.gz files are compressed copies of the
vendor-supplied documentation, which have some more details about the
driver and changelog.  The build instructions in those files don't apply
to this packaged version, of course.
